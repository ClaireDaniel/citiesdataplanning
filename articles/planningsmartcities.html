		<p class = "text mobileText">In <i> popular </i> terms the concept of 'Smart Cities' is approximately five years old in Australia
			 (although about ten years old internationally). Despite being ostentatiously about cities, the number of urban planners
			 involved is low, a fact pointed out by Anthony Townsend in their <a href = 'https://www.amazon.com.au/Smart-Cities-Anthony-M-Townsend/dp/0393082873' target = '_blank'>  well-known book </a>
			 on the topic back in 2013, and a fact that still rings true here today. It is a fact that, in my experience, has been met with
			 slight confusion from smart cities people. Having thought about this for a while though this fact is
			 not as unreasonable as it first seemed. Here is my take with three reasons why planners haven't engaged with smart cities
			 and what we could do about it.</p>

    <p class = "text mobileText"><b>1. Planning is not real time</b></p>
    <p class = "text mobileText">So much of smart city innovation and dialogue is based on the concept of the real-time city. Don't get
			me wrong, this is a useful and important concept; with real time feedback we can divert resources to where they are needed and
			respond to problems before they get out of hand. However, planners rarely care about real time. Planning work involves shaping
			policy for outcomes that won't be realised until 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 or more years into the future. To engage as planners we need
			much more dialogue about how this mountain of real time data can be meaningfully aggregated to help with this work.</p>

    <p class = "text mobileText"><b>2.	Planners care about the form and function of cities</b></p>
    <p class = "text mobileText">In all the conversation around smart devices, a clear message is still lacking around implications for
			the fundamental form and function of cities. It is great that we can now monitor how full our public bins are, and that we have
			more wifi in public spaces, but do these things fundamentally change how cities function and develop? And no, again I'm not dismissing
			smart devices, but to engage fully as planners we need dialogue that goes a few more steps beyond the devices themselves. Does this
			technology suggest we should fundamentally change the form and function of cities? Is it better for everyone to work from home? Will we
			 still need vast areas of landfill and buffers to separate residential and industrial uses? There are probably lots more important
			 questions to ask, although as it stands the current planning ideal of making sure more people
			 live in areas that are well serviced by mass public transport and other services seems to hold up pretty well.</p>

    <p class = "text mobileText"><b>3.	Digital innovation in planning is dependent upon public sector innovation</b></p>
    <p class = "text mobileText">Planning is principally involved in the governance of land development rights across society and decisions
			regarding expenditure on public infrastructure. These are functions that are core to government. Smart Cities
			dialogue started with and continues to be driven to a large degree by IoT and supporting tech service companies in the private sector, whether through established tech giants or the
			many start-ups generated through various recent smart city incubator programs. Much of the smart cities dialogue in Australia has been conducted separately
			from those involved in the public sector innovation sphere, in which we see strengthening recognition around the value of in-house
			tech expertise, human-centred rather than profit or convenience centred design, collaborative rather than competitive ways of working
			and open-source rather than proprietary software solutions. These things are heavily tied up with supporting the ideals of democratic
			governance and public purpose but can be at odds with many traditional private (and even public) sector business models. </p>

    <p class = "text mobileText">That's all I've got for now. Thoughts anyone? I wouldn't be surprised if a similar blog has been written before
			and would love to connect with others exploring this space. Hit me up on
