<h2 class = "subheading mobileSubheading"> Introduction to Rules as Code in Planning </h2>
		
		<p class ="date mobileDate"> 28 October 2021</p>
		
		<p class = "text mobileText">  Co-authored with, and simultaneously posted by, 
			<a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-barry-54878133>Richard Barry</a> (Senior Planning Consultant, Urbis) </p>
		
		<p class = "text mobileText"> <b>The whispers are getting louder, automated planning approvals are no longer a far-fetched 
			dream but a subject of serious consideration for planning authorities </b></p>

		<p class = "text mobileText">This technology has far-reaching implications for the way planners will go about their day to 
			day work and as such we need to be paying close attention to the way it is designed and implemented. 
			For those without a tech background this can seem daunting, however, the principles and technology 
			powering these systems, known variously as “Rules as Code” or “Legislation as Code”, can be broken 
			down into relatively simple concepts.</p>

		<p class = "text mobileText"> In June of this year Claire Daniel and Richard Barry teamed up to deliver a 
			“RaC 101 workshop” at the PIA National Planning Congress and have now turned this content into a 
			series of articles to share this information more widely. In this article we will cover some basic 
			definitions and theory. </p>

		<p class = "text mobileText">  In essence these systems rely on the translation of planning rules and policies 
			into computer code (or some other explicitly structured digital format) that can be used by a 
			computer, an attribute often referred to as “machine-readable”. This machine-readable translation 
			can then be used by many types of software applications, for example:
		
			<ul class = "text mobileText" style = "list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 12px;"> 
				<li>A website helping local residents understand the planning requirements for proposed development 
					on their property through a guided set of questions 
					(see Wellington City Council, New Zealand’s Resource Consent Checker) .</li>
				<li>Software to automate or streamline the preparation of documents required for a development 
					application.</li>
				<li>Automate assessment of simple development based on submitted information.</li>
				<li>Streamline assessment of more complex proposals, allowing planners to focus on 
					subjective or contentious aspects of development.</li>
				<li>Broad scale policy modelling utilising 3D city digital twins to measure the potential 
					cumulative impact of a rule change (e.g. the number of future dwellings in 
					an area under different floor space ratio constraints).</li>
				</ul>
		
		<p class = "text mobileText">It is important to note here that we are talking about the translation of prescriptive rules and 
			planning codes in the NSW and other similar planning systems (e.g. a housing code specifying minimum street setbacks). 
			Whilst some may be exploring applications that provide advice based on precedent (using statistical/AI models based on 
			data from past decisions) this is not within the scope of this article, and we urge caution in the use of this approach 
			where the prescriptive rules are intended to produce a black-and-white answer. Within the Australian system of zoning 
			and codes these prescriptive rules make up a large portion of our planning system, increasing the potential disruptive 
			impact of this approach.</p>

		<p class = "text mobileText">Now we understand something about what we are talking about, of equal or greater importance is 
			the question of how these machine-readable translations of planning rules are made. Here we see two approaches:</p>

		<ol class = "text mobileText" style = "list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 5px;">
			<li><b>Post-coded Rules</b> - A machine-readable translation is made of an existing set of planning rules.</li>
			<li><b>Co-drafted rules</b> - A machine-readable translation of the rules is drafted alongside the official rules with planners, lawyers and coders working together from the start.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Most rules as code applications so far developed for planning have utilised post-coded rules. Whilst useful, 
			through the process of coding there are inevitably difficulties arising. As any development assessment officer will attest, the interpretation 
			of even prescriptive rules can be difficult. Especially for long and detailed rule sets, such as those we find in planning codes, those 
			undertaking the translation inevitably find themselves inventing new definitions to fill gaps in the logic of the original policy. </p>

		<p class = "text mobileText"> Whilst there will be plenty of people who will offer to just do the code-translation for you, if the ‘code-translators’ are 
			working separately to the policy makers or decision makers, these definitions and interpretations may be quite different to the conventions intended 
			or adopted over time. So the best approach is for planners and coders to work together, even if the rules are already published. </p>

		<p class = "text mobileText">Although opportunities to re-write a planning scheme or planning codes from scratch are limited, co-drafting a 
			machine readable translation at the start offers the best chance to ensure that translation is as close to the original intent of the 
			rules as possible. This approach can even serve to improve the final rules, as the logic of which will be subject to testing by the 
			machine-readable translation throughout the drafting process. However, no matter how carefully drafted, a machine-readable translation of the 
			rules will always be just one possible interpretation.</p>

		<p class = "text mobileText">The interpretative difficulties give rise to a number of other important considerations for how machine-readable translations of planning rules are used. 
			In this case both Principle 3 and Principle 6 of PIA’s Digital Planning Principles may be applied:</p>

			<ol class = "text mobileText" start="3" style = "list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 5px;">
				<li><i><b>
					Digital planning infrastructure should be public infrastructure built with open technology
				</b></i></li>
			</ol>

			<ol class = "text mobileText" start="6" style = "list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 5px;">
				<li><i><b>
					Ethics, accountability and transparency must be built into digital decision systems
				</b></i></li>
			</ol>

		<p class = "text mobileText">In an increasingly digitised world computers are already being applied to the planning system and its rules, to automate work 
			and identify development opportunities. This use is not addressed in the way we currently draft planning rules and policies, but it needs to be - 
			both to unlock the benefits of technology that can improve the planning system through:</p>

			<ul class = "text mobileText" style = "list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 12px;">
				<li>A more easy to understand and accessible planning system to the community.</li>
				<li>Greater trust in decision making by preventing the problems that will arise from varied and black-box interpretations.</li>
				<li>Greater efficiency in the planning system by faster decision making for planning issues that can be automated.</li>
			</ul>

		<p class = "text mobileText"> At this point in time there is a tendency to pursue rules as code projects in planning quietly and as a technology project, without much involvement 
			from planners themselves. This also needs to change to ensure that these new systems support good planning outcomes, and so planners are ready for the changes to their day-to-day
			 work. In the following article we will be offering a practical exercise for those with no prior knowledge of coding that shows how planning rules can be translated into a 
			 machine readable format and incorporated into a simple software application. In the meantime, we would love to hear your thoughts and questions on twitter
