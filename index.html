			<h4 class = "description mobileDescription"> In 2019 we conducted a survey of practicing Australian planners to collect their perspectives on technology use 
				in the profession and anticipated change. The results have now been published in a peer-reviewed article in <a href = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07293682.2021.1920995 target="_blank">Australian Planner</a> co-authored with 
				Professor Chris Pettit. I would like to share the highlights with you below. </h4>

			<p class = "text mobileText">Past years have seen a new wave of digital innovation initiatives in city management and the delivery of government 
				services at large. Urban planning however is frequently viewed as "behind the times" with many of our sister professions in the built 
				environment now boasting relatively established approaches with PropTech in the real-estate and property development industry, computational 
				design in architecture and digital twins in the spatial and surveying industry - to name just a few.</p>
	
			<p class = "text mobileText">In 2019 we conducted a survey of and workshop with practicing Australian planners to find out:
				<ol class = "text mobileText">
					<li>How they currently use tech in their day-to-day work,</li>
					<li>What changes they anticipate,</li>
					<li>Any barriers to this change, and;</li>

			<p class = "text mobileText"><a href = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07293682.2021.1920995 target="_blank">The full paper was published last week in the Australian Planner </a> and should freely accessible 
				to all members of the Planning Institute of Australia. A pre-print version of the article is available for download above. 
				We have also created a <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/claire.daniel#!/vizhome/StakeholderDashboard/Dashboard1?publish=yes" target="_blank"> dashboard to allow for exploration of the survey data</a>. The following provides a summary of ten of the key findings.</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>1.	Planners rely on ‘traditional’ data and software</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">The Australian Bureau of Statistics was still the number one source of information for practicing planners, 
			followed by government open data platforms with both used by most respondents. On the other hand, only moderate use of social media 
			data was reported whilst IoT data ("internet of things" - an innovation considered key to smart cities initiatives) was used by less 
			than ten percent of respondents. Similarly, the reported use of more novel applications was low including scenario planning, 
			3D modelling and AR/VR applications, indicating that yet more work may need to be done if planners are to be convinced of their utility in practice.  </p>
	
			<p class = "text mobileText"><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/surveychart.png" width = '800' style="max-width:100%;"></p></p>
			<p class = "caption mobileCaption" style="text-align:center;">Data sources and software used by survey respondents in their day to day work</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>2.	Local government planners report using the widest variety of tech</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Local government planners reported to be far more likely to use online mapping, 
			GIS, 3D modelling, administrative systems, and 3D modelling software than their state government counterparts.</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>3.	There was little difference in tech use between junior and senior planners</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Surprisingly, comparison between respondents with less than 10 years’ experience and more than 10 years’ 
			experience revealed little difference in tech use - perhaps indicating that even if* younger professionals are more familiar 
			with various technologies, that they may not currently be afforded opportunities to apply these skills in their work. </p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>4.	Planners anticipate widespread change</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Despite reporting limited use of new and novel technologies, most respondents predict significant change 
			to occur to day-to-day planning work arising from digital technology. When asked to describe these changes three dominant themes 
			emerged - a <b>data-driven future</b> where new insights are gleaned from new data sources and computation capabilities; a <b>communicative 
			future</b> where the internet offers instantaneous transfer of information and communication at a distance; and finally, an <b>administratively 
			efficient future</b> where many bureaucratic and administrative functions are automated, such as for simple development approvals. </p>

			<p class = "caption mobileCaption" style="text-align:center;">Summary of free-form text responses</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>5.	There are a wide range of barriers to tech adoption in planning</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Responses describing barriers to the adoption of new tech in the workplace paint a complex picture which we summarised 
			under four themes - uncertainty in the adoption of new technology and whether the benefits of implementing a new technology will outweigh the 
			costs before it becomes redundant; poor quality technology including software that is difficult to use or note fit for purpose; costs and resources 
			not just in licencing fees and hardware upgrades but also in the time taken to train staff; and finally change resistance describing problems of 
			general cultural inertia stemming from institutional arrangements, individual reluctance and crucially lack of senior management support. </p>

			<p class = "caption mobileCaption" style="text-align:center;">Summary of free-form text responses</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>6.	Planners have lots of innovative ideas</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Planners participating in a workshop were asked to devise technological solutions to common frustrations encountered in 
			their work. They responded with enthusiasm and had little difficulty in devising a range of solutions, from improved data portals to simplified 
			assessment systems, which are detailed at more length in the paper.  </p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>7.	A lack of basic digital infrastructure may be hindering further innovation </b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">The solutions developed by workshop participants may suggest further reasons for the relatively low adoption of 
			new data-heavy and computationally intensive technology with most frustrations centered around difficulties in simple information 
			retrieval and communication tasks</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>8.	Set-process mindsets may hinder deeper innovation</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">When asked to outline their day-to-day work it was striking how quickly workshop participants were able to reach a 
			consensus when mapping out how to undertake common planning tasks such as preparing a masterplan, despite working across different organisations.  
			It would be interesting to investigate whether this high subscription to set processes could be a barrier to more widespread and 
			systematic innovation. We know from other digital innovation efforts in government that it is important to take the opportunity to re-evaluate 
			why things are done in certain ways and avoid simply hard-coding existing processes in new automated systems. </p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>9.	The workplace is still important to continued professional development</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Although if you are reading this article you have probably found it through Twitter or LinkedIn, 
			our results show that for most planners that these are among the least important sources of new information about the latest 
			developments in the industry, with more traditional sources including the workplace, seminars and conferences, alongside web 
			searches, ranked as more commonly used.</p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText"><b>10.  The results of this survey provide a limited perspective</b></p>
		<p class = "text mobileText">Not so much a finding as a caution (it also felt unsatisfactory to leave this article at nine) that this survey presents only the 
			views of practicing planners, around 100 people and mostly located in the State of New South Wales in Australia. It could be complemented by further 
			research to gather views from other stakeholders in the process, in particularly the community at large who are often underrepresented 
			in these types of studies. </p>
	
		<p class = "text mobileText">So, in conclusion it is hoped that the findings of this research provide a practical framework of considerations when it comes to 
			implementing technology in urban planning. These findings demonstrate that, counter to some popular opinion, planners at large are far from oblivious when it comes 
			to the possibilities and expected changes arising from continued improvements to digital technology. Including their perspectives will be necessary if we are 
			to get the best outcomes from this new wave of digital transformation efforts.  </p>
